ThManager is a cave projects manager.

The "cave project" files are Therion config files in the directory "thconfig" of TopoDroid.
The thconfig file is save whenever the project is closed.
The survey files are Therion th files in the directory "th" of TopoDroid.
Projects can be exported as Therion or Survex files; exports are saved in the "th" and "svx" directories,
respectively.


MAIN WINDOW 

When you start ThManager it displays the thconfig files from the TopoDroid/thconfig directory.
If this directory does not exist, the app creates it, and the thconfig list is empty.
N.B. if you are working with another TopoDroid than the default, change the CWD (current work
directory) to there, with the "Options" menu.

Buttons:
- create a new thconfig
- app settings
- this help
- exit


THCONFIG WINDOW

When you tap a thconfig file, the app switches to show the list of th files contained in the project.
If the project does not contain any th file, the list is empty, but you can easily add th files to it.

Buttons:
- add surveys (th files) to the project
- drop surveys from the project
- display the selected surveys (in plan view)
- list the project equates
- 3D display (with Cave3D)
- export the project in Therion or Survex format
- delete the project
- exit

When a survey file is dropped, the equates with its stations are also deleted.


VIEW WINDOW

The survey are displayed in plan view, with midline and station names.
Each survey has a different color (after a while colors repeat).
Equates are shown as dashed red lines, and equated stations have a round background.
The view can be panned and zoomed.
A survey can be grabbed (tap on a station: it gets circled) and dragged around while the other surveys do not move.
In this way you can overlap stations of different surveys that you want to equate.
When they overlap circle them both by tapping the point: you can then insert the equate between them with the menu "add equate".

It is advisible to work with two surveys at a time.

Buttons:
- add a new equate
- list the project equates
- exit

You can drop an equate by tapping its entry.
